About
=====
This is a plug-in for weechat written in python that allows you to search
for a given term on wikipedia and receive the search result link in weechat.

It is my first script in python written in the scope of study and learning,
if you feel something is not write I am glad to receive patches so I can learn
more from you. Thank you and I hope you will enjoy this plug-in.

Usage:

`<!wikilink> [search term]` - general syntax

`!wikilink weechat` - search for the term weechat on http://www.wikipedia.org/
